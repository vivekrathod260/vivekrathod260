✨ *“Curiosity + Creativity + Problem Solving = My Developer Journey”* ✨


I don’t define myself by a framework — I’m an engineering thinker who focuses on learning, problem-solving, and delivering value across any tech stack.

My biggest strength lies in adaptability: I don’t see frameworks as boundaries but as tools. Whether it’s the .NET world, Python’s ecosystem, or modern JavaScript stacks, I focus on solving problems through **engineering principles**, not just syntax.

This cross-stack experience isn’t just surface-level; each framework represents a complete project I’ve delivered — web, mobile, and backend.
